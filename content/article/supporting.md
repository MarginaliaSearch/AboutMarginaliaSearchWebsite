I'm just one guy building all of this on my own.  My hope is that it will bring value to its users and enable a thriving independent Internet. 

The search engine doesn't have any secret sauce, all the [source code is publicly available](https://git.marginalia.nu/) and as far as is legally and logistically possible, the [data](https://downloads.marginalia.nu/) is also available. 

The entire work is funded by my own savings, supplemented by grants and public donations.  To this end I have a few donation links. Every last bit helps and even a modest contribution is greatly appreciated and will lengthen the time I'm able to work like this.

You can also just send me an email at contact@marginalia-search.com and we can discuss other alternatives.  

Note: I am reluctant to receive direct bank transfers or smaller cryptocurrency donations due to the extremely controlling and hostile banking landscape of Sweden.
